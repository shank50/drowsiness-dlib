# Drowsiness Detection System using DLib

This project uses facial landmarks to monitor drowsiness in real-time using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to prompts/alertss whether a person is awake or drowsy.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

* Real-time video feed processing using OpenCV
* DLib facial landmark detection (68 points)
* EAR-based thresholding to detect eye closure
* Works on a customizable thresholding.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *The system will open your camera feed and begin monitoring for drowsiness immediately.*

## ðŸ“‚ Model File

The shape predictor file `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` can be fetched from Dlib's official site too.

## ðŸ“š Reference

This implementation is inspired by the concepts presented in:
